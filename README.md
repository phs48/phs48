# ðŸ‘‹  Hi! 

I'm Peter Hicks, and I am a Technical Lead to the lovely people at 
[Space 48](https://www.space48.com/). I spend my  days looking after BigCommerce 
and Shopify projects for some [fantastic clients](https://www.space48.com/work/).

When not buried in Jira or getting excited about delivering great ecommerce
experiences, I'm an avid gamer, manage several online communities and support 
groups, and a friend to rabbits everywhere.
